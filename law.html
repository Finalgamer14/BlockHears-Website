		<h2>Extra law info:</h2>
		<p>Landscape laws include making sure you either restore a habitat to sustainability (replant tree's, replace dirt or sand areas mined up, or make it visually apparent that you have used these areas and want them to look this way, quarry buildings, fences, etc)</p>
		<p>Mesa biomes can be mined to fuck and we know they will be, but make sure you don't leave them looking like absolute wank.</p>
		<p>Please build places in each of your areas where we can hold meetings and such.</p>
