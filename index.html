		<h1>Welcome to BlockHeart</h1>
		<h2>Vision:</h2>

		<p>Everyone to have a strong and stable link to the central spawn area. We will achieve this by ensuring everyone has either a house, build, or even a region in the form of a city district at spawn, beinga village, town or whatever. All the poeples starter towns at spawn must be carefully thought out and follow their own respective aesthetic patterns, and will all link eventually to create spawn city. Therefore each person contributing to these must consider that they will be a district of a larger settlement, and to not make anything griefy or ugly which will stand out. These need to be built around the city centre which we will all eventually build, and it will adhere to my aesthetic, which i will decide upon soon, as this will be my main project. Spawn curfue will be lifted when there is sufficient activity around spawn, and i will then lift the border and allow people to spread and find their new areas. </p>

		<p>The whitelist is closed but later on Coco will advertise or recrui promising builders or youtubers who want to join and are willing to add to our cummunity.</p>
